  I would have to say that PEP8 has many things that I agree with. Most of
all, the convention of breaking a line before binary operators so as to line
them up neatly for readability. The fact that PEP8 advises to stick to
mathematical conventions wherever possible, is also something that I agree with.

  There really isn't anything that I disagree with, although in the future I'm
sure that will probably change. As it is though, I don't think I've had enough
experience to be able to challenge conventions.

  Why do I think PEP8 is important? Conventions are one of the most powerful
intellectual tools mankind has developed. Conventions like this allow us to
communicate effectively, and with consistency. They not only set standards, but
also quell debate within the community, making room for more innovative and
 productive thinking.
